    body: '<p>Through the power of sports and technology, Greater is aimed at redefining education so that all students from all backgrounds are equipped for 21st century opportunities. We believe the answer to the problems we’re facing in the world today can be solved once we create a deeper roster of leaders who are willing to serve.We think if you’re willing to serve, you are willing to lead. And if you’re willing to lead, you are willing to mentor others to do the same. Through exposure, access, and education boosted by neighborhood partnerships, we believe we can foster change. Our goal is to break the cycle of at-risk youth to create a new class of global citizens who are equipped to grow through their circumstances with personal responsibilities to their communities — and the world. Our programs aim to serve this purpose.</p>',

    body:'<p>Society will draw a circle that shuts me out, but my superior thoughts will draw me in. I was born to win if I do not spend too much time trying to fail. I can become a citizen of the world if I do not spend too many energies attempting to become local. I will ignore the tags and names given my by society since only I know what I have the ability to become. I will continue to let society predict, but only I can determine what I will, can, or cannot do. Failure is just as easy to combat as success to obtain. Education is painful and not gained by playing games, but I have seen failure too destroy millions with promised hopes and broken dreams. While I have the opportunity, I shall not sit on the sideline bitter with despair and wish later that I had become a literate lifter of this world instead of a failing leaner. I will use each day to the fullest. I promise that each day shall be gained, not lost, used, not thrown away. Yet it is my privilege to destroy myself if that is what I choose to do. I have the right to fail, but I do not have the right to take my teacher and other people with me. I am the captain of only one life, my own.  Therefore of I decide to become a failure, it is my right. We were all promised the pursuit of happiness, and that is what I must do, pursue happiness and success for myself. Im King of the World! No one will give it to me on a proverbial platter, and on one will care as much about me as I must care about myself. But I must be willing to accept the consequences for that failure and I must never think that those who have chosen to work while I played, rested, and slept, will share their bounties with me. I will wave proudly my flag signifying that I am a failure by choice.  but I will never envy those who have selected to wave their unfurled banners announcing their success. My success and my education can be a companion.  Which no misfortune can depress, no crime can destroy, no enemy can alienate, no envy or names can hurt me. Education and success can be a lifetime solace. It guides goodness, it gives at once grace and genius to governments, communities, cities, township, villages homes and palaces. Without education, what is man? A splendid slave, a savage, a beast, wandering from here to there believing whatever they are told. A Higher Power is not some cosmic bellboy who comes at out beckon and call.  If I want to achieve that first step must be of my own undertaking. Likewise, if I want to fail, that too is my choice. Time and chance comes to us all.  Whether I decide to take that time and chance is indeed my own choice. I can either be hesitant or courageous. Life does indeed maroon the hesitant and inspire the brave. I can swiftly stand up and shout, “This is my time and place. I will accept the challenge, or I will let others make my decisions for me.” I can swiftly stand up and shout, “This is my time and place. I will accept the challenge, or I will let others make my decisions for me.”</p>',

    body:'<p>Its the full story of life crushed into 4 minutes. The entirety of humanity in the palm of your hand crushed into one sentence. Listen, its intense right.God. Our. Sins. Paying. Everyone. Life. The greatest story ever told, thats hardly ever told. God. Yes. God. The maker and giver of life. And by life I mean any and all matter and substance. Seen and unseen. What can and cant be touched. Thoughts, image, emotions, love, atoms and oceans, God. All of it his handy work. One of which is masterpiece. Made so uniquely that angels looked curiously. The one thing in creation that was made with his imagery. The concept so cold. Its the reason I stay bold, how God breathed in the man and he became a living soul. Formed with the intent of being infinitely, intimately fond. Creator and creation held in eternal bold. And it was placed in perfect paradise til something went wrong. A species got deceived and started lusting for his job. An odd list of complaints, as if the system aint working. And used that same breath he graciously gave us to curse him. And that sin seed spread though our souls genome. And by nature of your nature, your species, you participated in the mutiny. Our. Yes. Our sins. Its nature inherited, lack in the human heart. It was over before it started. Deceived from day one and lead away by our own lusts. Theres not a religion in the word that doesnt agree that somethings wrong with us. The question is what is it? And how do we fix it? Are we eternally separated from a God that may or not have existed? But thats another subject. Lets keep grinding. Besides trying to prove God is like defending a lion homie. It dont need your help, just unlock the cage. Lets move on how our debt can be paid. Short and sweet.The problem is Sin. Yes. Sin.Its a cancer. An asthma. Choking out our life force. Forcing separation from a perfect and holy God, and the only way to get back is to get back to perfection, but silly us, trying to pass the course of life without referring to a syllabus. This is us keep up your good deeds. Chant, pray, meditate.But all of that of course is spraying cologne on a corpse, or you could choose to ignore it as if something dont stink. Its like stepping it dog poop and refusing to wipe your shoe, but all of that ends with how good is good enough? Take your silly list of good deeds and line them up against perfection, good luck, thats life past your pay grade. The cost of your soul you aint gotta big enough piggy bank, but you could give it a shot, but I suggest you throw away the list, cause even your good acts are an extension of your selfishness, but heres where it gets interesting I hope your closely listening,please dont get it twisted. Its what makes our faith unique. Heres what God says is part A of the gospel, you cant fix yourself, quit trying its impossible. Sin brings death, give God his breath back, you owe him. Eternally separated and the only way to fix it is someone die in your place, and that someone gotta be perfect or the payment aint permanent. So if and when you find the perfect person, get him or her to willing trade their perfection for your sin and death in clearly since the only one that can meet Gods criteria is God. God sent himself as Jesus to pay the cost for us, His righteousness, His death, functions as Payment.Yes. Payment.Wrote a check with his life but at the resurrection we all cheered cause that means the check cleared. Pierced feet, pierced hands, blood stained Son of Man. Fullness, forgiveness, free passage into the promise land. That same breath God breathed into us God gave up to redeem us, and anyone and everyone, and by Everyone, I mean Everyone who puts their faith in trust in Him and Him alone can stand in full confidence of Gods forgiveness, and heres what the promise is: That you are guaranteed full access to return to perfect unity. By simply believing in Christ and Christ alone. You are receiving Life. Yes. Life. This is the Gospel. God. Our. Sins. Paying. Everyone. Life</p>',
